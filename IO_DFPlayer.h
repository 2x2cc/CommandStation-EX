/*
 * DFPlayer is an MP3 player module with an SD card holder.  It also has an integrated
 * amplifier, so it only needs a power supply and a speaker.
 * 
 * This driver allows the device to be controlled through IODevice::write() and 
 * IODevice::writeAnalogue() calls.
 * 
 * The driver is configured as follows:
 * 
 *       DFPlayer::create(firstVpin, nPins, Serialn);
 * 
 * Where firstVpin is the first vpin reserved for reading the device,
 *       nPins is the number of pins to be allocated (max 5)
 *   and Serialn is the name of the Serial port connected to the DFPlayer (e.g. Serial1).
 * 
 * Example:
 *   In mySetup function within mySetup.cpp:
 *       DFPlayer::create(3500, 5, Serial1);
 * 
 * Writing an analogue value 1-2999 to the first pin (3500) will play the numbered file from the SD card;
 * Writing an analogue value 0 to the first pin (3500) will stop the file playing;
 * Writing an analogue value 0-30 to the second pin (3501) will set the volume;
 * Writing a digital value of 1 to a pin will play the file corresponding to that pin, e.g.
   the first file will be played by setting pin 3500, the second by setting pin 3501 etc.;
 * Writing a digital value of 0 to any pin will stop the player;
 * Reading a digital value from any pin will return true(1) if the player is playing, false(0) otherwise.
 * 
 * From EX-RAIL, the following commands may be used:
 *   SET(3500)      -- starts playing the first file (file 1) on the SD card
 *   SET(3501)      -- starts playing the second file (file 2) on the SD card
 *   etc.
 *   RESET(3500)    -- stops all playing on the player
 *   WAITFOR(3500)  -- wait for the file currently being played by the player to complete
 *   SERVO(3500,2,Instant)  -- plays file 2 at current volume
 *   SERVO(3501,20,Instant)   -- Sets the volume to 20
 * 
 * NB The DFPlayer's serial lines are not 5V safe, so connecting the Arduino TX directly 
 * to the DFPlayer's RX terminal will cause lots of noise over the speaker, or worse.
 * A 1k resistor in series with the module's RX terminal will alleviate this.
 * 
 * Files on the SD card are numbered according to their order in the directory on the 
 * card (as listed by the DIR command in Windows).  This may not match the order of the files 
 * as displayed by Windows File Manager, which sorts the file names.  It is suggested that
 * files be copied into an empty SDcard in the desired order, one at a time.
