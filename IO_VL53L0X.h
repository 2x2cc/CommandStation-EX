/*
 * The VL53L0X Time-Of-Flight sensor operates by sending a short laser pulse and detecting
 * the reflection of the pulse.  The time between the pulse and the receipt of reflections
 * is measured and used to determine the distance to the reflecting object.
 * 
 * For economy of memory and processing time, this driver includes only part of the code 
 * that ST provide in their API.  Also, the API code isn't very clear and it is not easy
 * to identify what operations are useful and what are not. 
 * The operation shown here doesn't include any calibration, so is probably not as accurate
 * as using the full driver, but it's probably accurate enough for the purpose.
 * 
 * The device driver allocates up to 3 vpins to the device.  A digital read on the first pin
 * will return a value that indicates whether the object is within the threshold range (1)
 * or not (0).  An analogue read on the first pin returns the last measured distance (in mm), 
 * the second pin returns the signal strength, and the third pin returns detected 
 * ambient light level.  By default the device takes around 60ms to complete a ranging 
 * operation, so we do a 100ms cycle (10 samples per second).
 * 
 * The VL53L0X is initially set to respond to I2C address 0x29.  If you only have one module,
 * you can use this address.  However, the address can be modified by software.  If
 * you select another address, that address will be written to the device and used until the device is reset.
 * 
 * If you have more than one module, then you will need to specify a digital VPIN (Arduino
 * digital output or I/O extender pin) which you connect to the module's XSHUT pin.  Now,
 * when the device driver starts, the XSHUT pin is set LOW to turn the module off.  Once 
 * all VL53L0X modules are turned off, the driver works through each module in turn,
 * setting XSHUT to HIGH to turn that module on, then writing that module's desired I2C address.
 * In this way, many VL53L0X modules can be connected to the one I2C bus, each one 
 * using a distinct I2C address.  The process is described in ST Microelectronics application
 * note AN4846.
 * 
 * WARNING:  If the device's XSHUT pin is not connected, then it is very prone to noise, 
 * and the device may reset spontaneously or when handled and the device will stop responding
 * on its allocated address.  If you're not using XSHUT, then tie it to +5V via a resistor 
 * (should be tied to +2.8V strictly). Some manufacturers (Adafruit and Polulu for example)
 * include a pull-up on the module, but others don't.
 * 
 * The driver is configured as follows:
 * 
 * Single VL53L0X module:
 *      VL53L0X::create(firstVpin, nPins, i2cAddress, lowThreshold, highThreshold);
 * Where firstVpin is the first vpin reserved for reading the device,
 *       nPins is 1, 2 or 3,
 *       i2cAddress is the address of the device (normally 0x29),
 *       lowThreshold is the distance at which the digital vpin state is set to 1 (in mm),
 *   and highThreshold is the distance at which the digital vpin state is set to 0 (in mm).
 * 
 * Multiple VL53L0X modules:
 *       VL53L0X::create(firstVpin, nPins, i2cAddress, lowThreshold, highThreshold, xshutPin);
 *       ...
 * Where firstVpin is the first vpin reserved for reading the device,
 *       nPins is 1, 2 or 3,
 *       i2cAddress is the address of the device (any valid address except 0x29),
 *       lowThreshold is the distance at which the digital vpin state is set to 1 (in mm),
 *       highThreshold is the distance at which the digital vpin state is set to 0 (in mm),
 *   and xshutPin is the VPIN number corresponding to a digital output that is connected to the
 *       XSHUT terminal on the module.  The digital output may be an Arduino pin or an
 *       I/O extender pin.
 * 
 * Example:
 *   In mySetup function within mySetup.cpp:
 *      VL53L0X::create(4000, 3, 0x29, 200, 250);
 *      Sensor::create(4000, 4000, 0);  // Create a sensor
 * 
 *   When an object comes within 200mm of the sensor, a message 
 *      <Q 4000>
 *   will be sent over the serial USB, and when the object moves more than 250mm from the sensor, 
 *   a message
 *      <q 4000>
 *   will be sent. 
 *
