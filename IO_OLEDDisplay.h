/* 
 * This driver provides a more immediate interface into the OLED display
 * than the one installed through the config.h file.  When an LCD(...) call
 * is made, the text is output immediately to the specified display line,
 * without waiting for the next 2.5 second refresh.  However, no scrolling
 * takes place, so if the line specified is off the screen then the text
 * will instead be shown on the bottom line of the screen.
 * 
 * To install, use the following command in myHal.cpp:

 *    OLEDDisplay::create(address, width, height);
 * 
 * where address is the I2C address (0x3c or 0x3d),
 * width is the width in pixels of the display, and
 * height is the height in pixels of the display.
 * 
 * Valid width and height are 128x32 (SSD1306 controller), 
 * 128x64 (SSD1306) and 132x64 (SH1106).  The driver uses
 * a 5x7 character set in a 6x8 pixel cell.
