// a linear address, or by an address/subaddress pair, where the subaddress is
// in the range 0 to 3 and specifies an output within a group of 4.

// are not specified by the NMRA and so different manufacturers may calculate them
// in different ways.  DCC++EX uses a range of 1-2044 which excludes decoder address 0.
// Linear address 1 corresponds to address 1 subaddress 0.
